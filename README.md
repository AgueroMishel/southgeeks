### Limitations:

The challenge was originally requested in Java, but due to time constraints (1 hour) and the fact that I wasn't notified that it needed to be done in Java, my local environment was not set up for Java development. As a result, I chose to complete the challenge using Javascript/Cypress instead. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

### Assupmtions:
- Node is properly installed

## Setup
1. Clone repo and go the local repo (in your local)
2. Execute `npm install cypress`
3. Execute `npm install`

## Execution
**Window/Debug Mode:** `npm run cy:open`
Click on any test file to execute

Note: for more execution modes go to `./package.json` into script section
